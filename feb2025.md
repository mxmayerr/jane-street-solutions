### The Puzzle

We are given an image containing various words and seemingly unrelated numerical directions on the side (click the link above or  [here](https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/top-score-give-or-take.jpg)  to see the image). We are told that the answer is a proper noun.

### Initial Observations/Questions

- What are the *mysterious* directions on the right side? What do those numbers correspond to? What do the colors mean?
- The words are in groups of 7, seemingly split into 14 on the top and 14 on the bottom, and each group of 14 words are organized in alphabetical order.
- What does the title *'give or take'* imply? 

### Initial Strategy

I had various initial approaches which led me to the correct approach:

 1. I looked at the scrabble sum of each word to see if it would lead me to anything. I noticed that the top group of words scored 40pts higher then the bottom half (back to this later), but I didn't find anything else useful, so I moved on.
 2. I looked at the length of the words themselves, and noticed that the top group had 7 more characters total - but still, wasn't able to conclude anything useful.

### Strategy

> Note: The following strategy may not be the most efficient process to solve the problem, but it is how I went about it in my head.

The approaches above didn't yeild anything useful until I took out the [word unscrambler](https://wordunscrambler.me). Initially, this was just another 'let me just try this' method, but it actually led to some progress.

I noticed some of the words on the image were really *weird* that were included. What does 'cuirass' mean? I figured they must have been included for a reason, and when sent to the word unscambler (with a wildcard * since this word specifically doesn't unscramble to anything), I found the word 'jurassic'. I thought this was a good step in the right direction.

I started to unscramble some of the *'weird'* words with wildcards (again, since they dont unscramble to anything helpful themselves). I found the following (bold = wildcard letter):

- NOCTURNES >> ENCOUNT**E**RS
- ISOMER >> ME**M**OIRS

With 3 seemingly random and weird words that unscramble, with a wild, to a 'normal'-like word was what I felt was a good step in the right direction. I turned my focus to the title. 

The phrase 'Give or Take' in the title made more sense now; it was almost like the words in the second group were 'taking' letters (with the wildcard), and so that must mean the top group must be 'giving' letters. At this point, I started to put the top words into the unscrambler and looking for words with length-1, in which the letter removed is the letter given to the bottom group. 

| top group word (give): | *...gives letter:* | ...to become: | Then, bottom group word (take): | ...takes letter to become: |
|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| SURFACED | *F* | CRUSADE | RIDDLE | FIDDLER |
| ASTIR | *I* | STAR | TRIONYM | MINORITY |
| BLACK | *L* | BACK | SAT | LAST |
| SWARM | *M* | WARS | HOE | HOME |
| STICKER | *C* | STRIKES | SOLE | CLOSE |
| OKRA | *O* | ARK | FOR | ROOF |
| ADMIRERS | *M* | RAIDERS | ISOMER | MEMOIRS |
| WRAP | *P* | WAR | ARK | PARK |
| HOAGIES | *O* | GEISHA | LANE | ALONE |
| PREMISE | *S* | EMPIRE | CHILDREN’S | SCHINDLER’S |
| DITHER | *E* | THIRD | NOCTURNES | ENCOUNTERS |
| DRINK | *R* | KIND | TROPE | REPORT |
| JOLTS | *J* | LOST | CUIRASS | JURASSIC |
| WILTS | *W* | LIST | LORDS | WORLDS |


Now, you may have noticed the secret phrase in the *gives letter...* column and are wondering why the rows are ordered like that...

For the first set of directions "1 [red] on the 6 [red]", we can use the words FIDDLER and ROOF (both red, second group, since they are taking letters). from above to get *Fiddler on the Roof*. In doing so, this assigns FIDDLER the number 1 and ROOF the number 6 (this also assigns their counterparts, the words that gave the letters, to the same numbers, so CRUSADE is 1 [blue] and ARK is 6 [blue]). Another example is "2 [blue] 4 [blue]", which would be *Star Wars*, assigning STAR to 2 and WARS to 4, which is why you see STAR in row 2 and WARS in row 4.

Writing out the secret column message, you get FILM COMPOSER JW, which is a major hint (along with the 14 movie titles) to the answer to the puzzle.


### Answer

Thus, the final answer to this month’s puzzle is **John Williams.**
